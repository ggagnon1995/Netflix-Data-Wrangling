# Netflix-Data-Wrangling
Data wrangling using Netflix data

The purpose of this exercise is to cover all the basic areas of data wrangling in Python. World-wide Netflix viewer data is obtained for the time period March 2021 - January 2022. The data is broken down into two final data frames that represent each countries #1 most watched show and #1 most watched movie based on the number of weeks the title was in that countries top 10. Once the data is processed, it is loaded into Tableau to generate an interactive graph where you can see which countries liked the same titles. 

One result might make you laugh - The movie Canada liked the most was "How the Grinch Stole Christmas"!
